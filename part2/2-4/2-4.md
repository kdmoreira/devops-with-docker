# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.4
In this exercise you should expand the configuration done in Exercise 2.3 and set up the example backend to use the key-value database Redis.  
The backend uses a slow API to fetch some information. You can test the slow API by requesting `/ping?redis=true` with curl. The frontend app has a button to test this.  
Submit the docker-compose.yml

```console
docker compose up
```

Result:

```console
[+] Building 0.0s (0/0)

To fix this issue add 'vm.overcommit_memory = 1' to /etc/sysctl.conf and then reboot or run the command 'sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1' for this to take effect.
