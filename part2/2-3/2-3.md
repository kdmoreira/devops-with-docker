# PART 2
## MANDATORY EXERCISE 2.3
As we saw previously, starting an application with two programs was not trivial and the commands got a bit long.  
In the previous part we created Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend of the example application. Next, simplify the usage into one docker-compose.yml.  
Configure the backend and frontend from part 1 to work in Docker Compose.  
Submit the docker-compose.yml

Clone the repository with the projects:

```console
git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications
```

After adding each Dockerfile to their respective project folders in the cloned repository, run:

```console
docker compose up
```

Result:
```console
