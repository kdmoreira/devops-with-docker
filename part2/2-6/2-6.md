# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.6
Now you should add database to example backend.  
Use a Postgres database to save messages. For now there is no need to configure a volume since the official postgres image sets a default volume for us.  
The backend README should have all the information needed to connect.  
Submit the `docker-compose.yml`

Result:

*Given the Dockerfiles inside each project and the `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as `material-applications` cloned repository, run:*

```console
docker compose up
```

```console
