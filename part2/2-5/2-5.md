# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.5
The project https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/scaling-exercise is a bearly working application. Go ahead and clone it for yourself. The project already includes docker-compose.yml so you can start it by running docker compose up.  
Application should be accessible through http://localhost:3000. However it doesn't work well enough and I've added a load balancer for scaling. Your task is to scale the compute containers so that the button in the application turns green.  
This exercise was created with Sasu Mäkinen  
Please return the used commands for this exercise.  

```console
docker compose up --scale compute=3
```
Result:
