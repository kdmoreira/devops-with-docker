# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.10
Now we have the reverse proxy up and running! All the communication to 
our app should be done through the reverse proxy and direct access 
(eg. accessing the backend with a GET to http://localhost:8080/ping ) 
should be prevented.

Use a port scanner, eg https://hub.docker.com/r/networkstatic/nmap 
to ensure that there are no extra ports open in the host.

Result:

```console
docker run -it --rm --network host networkstatic/nmap localhost
