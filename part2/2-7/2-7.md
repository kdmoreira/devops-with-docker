# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.7
Postgres image uses a volume by default. Define manually a volume for the database in a convenient location such as in `./database` so you should use now a bind mount. The image documentation may help you with the task.  
After you have configured the bind mount volume:
- Save a few messages through the frontend

Result:

*Given the Dockerfiles inside each project and the `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as `material-applications` cloned repository, run:*

```console
docker compose up

sudo ls database
[sudo] password for karina:

base          pg_ident.conf  pg_serial     pg_tblspc    postgresql.auto.conf
global        pg_logical     pg_snapshots  pg_twophase  postgresql.conf
pg_commit_ts  pg_multixact   pg_stat       PG_VERSION   postmaster.opts
pg_dynshmem   pg_notify      pg_stat_tmp   pg_wal       postmaster.pid
pg_hba.conf   pg_replslot    pg_subtrans   pg_xact
```

*Bind mount has been created.  
Go to http://localhost:5000/, check all buttons, save messages...*

- Run `docker compose down`

Result:

```console
docker compose down

TIP: To save you the trouble of testing all of those steps, just look into the folder before trying the steps. If it's empty after `docker compose up` then something is wrong.

Submit the `docker-compose.yml`
