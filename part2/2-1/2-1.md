# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.1
Let us now leverage the Docker Compose with the simple webservice that we used in the Exercise 1.3. Without a command `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` will create logs into its `/usr/src/app/text.log`.  
Create a docker-compose.yml file that starts `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` and saves the logs into your filesystem.  
Submit the docker-compose.yml, make sure that it works simply by running `docker compose up` if the log file exists.

```console
touch text.log
docker compose up
