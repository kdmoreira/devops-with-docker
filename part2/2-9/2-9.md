# PART 2
## EXERCISE 2.9
Most of the buttons may have stopped working in the example application.  
Make sure that every button for exercises works.
If you had to do any changes explain what you did and where.  
Submit the `docker-compose.yml` and both Dockerfiles.

Result:

Change REQUEST_ORIGIN in back-end's Dockerfile:
`REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost`

Change REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL in front-end's Dockerfile:
`REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api`

Given the Dockerfiles inside each project and the `docker-compose.yml` in the same directory as `material-applications` cloned repository, run:

```console
docker compose build
```

This will update both back-end and front-end images.  
Then run:

```console
docker compose up                                      
```
