# PART 1
## EXERCISE 1.11: SPRING
- Create a Dockerfile for an old Java Spring project that can be found from the course repository. The setup should be straightforward with the README instructions. Tips to get you started:
Use openjdk image `FROM openjdk:_tag_` to get Java instead of installing it manually. Pick the tag by using the README and Docker Hub page.
You've completed the exercise when you see a 'Success' message in your browser. Submit the Dockerfile you used to run the container.

```console
git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications
cp -rf material-applications/spring-example-project .
cp Dockerfile spring-example-project
cd spring-example-project
docker build . -t simple-button
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:8001:8080 simple-button
```
