# PART 1
## EXERCISE 1.10: PORTS OPEN

In Exercise 1.8 you already did a image that can be used to run the web service without any argument. Use now the `-p` flag to access the contents with your browser. The output to your browser should be something like: `{ message: "You connected to the following path: ...}`
Submit your used commands for this exercise.
