# PART 1
## MANDATORY EXERCISE 1.12: HELLO, FRONTEND!
- A good developer creates well-written READMEs. Such that they can be used to create Dockerfiles with ease. Clone, fork or download the project from https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/example-frontend. Create a Dockerfile for the project (example-frontend) and give a command so that the project runs in a Docker container with port 5000 exposed and published so when you start the container and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` you will see message if you're successful. Note that the port 5000 is reserved in the more recent OSX versions (Monterey, Big Sur), so you have to use some other host port.
Submit the Dockerfile.

```console
git clone https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications
cp -rf material-applications/example-frontend .
cd example-frontend
touch Dockerfile
code .
docker build . -t example-frontend:alpine
docker run -d -p "127.0.0.1:5001:5000" example-frontend:alpine
```
