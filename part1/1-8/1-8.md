# PART 1
## EXERCISE 1.8: TWO LINE DOCKERFILE
- In this exercise create a Dockerfile and use FROM and CMD to create 
a brand new image that automatically runs server.
Tag the new image as "web-server".

```console
docker build . -t web-server

Use 'docker scan' to run Snyk tests against images to find vulnerabilities and learn how to fix them
