# PART 1
## EXERCISE 1.9: VOLUMES
- Image `devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service` creates a timestamp every two seconds to `/usr/src/app/text.log` when it's not given a command. Start the container with bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem. Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

```console
touch text.log
docker run -v "$(pwd)/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log" devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service

Starting log output
Wrote text to /usr/src/app/text.log
Wrote text to /usr/src/app/text.log
Wrote text to /usr/src/app/text.log
