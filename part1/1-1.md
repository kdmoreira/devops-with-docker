# PART 1
## EXERCISE 1.1: GETTING STARTED
- Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.
```console
docker container run -d nginx
docker run -d tomcat
docker run -d jetty
```

- Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.
```console
docker stop 9fac 68a6
```

- Submit the output for docker ps -a which shows 2 stopped containers and one running.
```console
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                        PORTS                    NAMES
